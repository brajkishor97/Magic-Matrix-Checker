What is Magic Square Matrix ?
A Magic square is an arrangement of the numbers from 1 to n^2 (n-squared) in an  n x n matrix, with each number occurring exactly once, and such that the sum of the entries of any row, any column, or any diagonal is the same. Sum of 3x3 matrix must be 15.

Algorithm to check magic matrix.
Find sum of principal diagonal and anti principal diagonal.
Calculate sum of each rows and columns.
If the prime diagonal and secondary diagonal sums is equal to every row’s sum and every column’s sum, then it is magic matrix. otherwise it is not Magic Square Matrix.
