What is Magic Square:
In recreational mathematics and combinatorial design, a magic square is a square grid filled with distinct positive integers in the range such that each cell contains a different integer and the sum of the integers in each row, column and diagonal is equal.  

The above one is just an example. The solution must be implemented with the help of GUI. Design a GUI with HTML and CSS and then write the logic in JavaScript.

My final output:  I should see the output on a webpage. A square with 9 boxed and a text input box for each square. I will input the numbers and click the button and it should state whether it is true or false .
